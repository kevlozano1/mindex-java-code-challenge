There were no datatypes specified in the readme for Compensation
Because of this I set salary and effectiveDate to Strings but they could easily be switched to float and Date respectively


Changes (sorry I forgot to set up with git until the end)
slight tweak to config/MongoConfig.java to read in Compensation repository
Added:
controller/CompensationController.java
controller/ReportingStructureController.java
dao/CompensationRepository.java
data/Compensation.java
data/ReportingStructure.java
service/CompensationService.java
service/ReportingStructureService.java
service/impl/CompensationServiceImpl.java
service/impl/ReportingStructureServiceImpl.java

tests/service/impl/CompensationServiceImplTest.java
tests/service/impl/ReportingStructureServiceImplTest.java
